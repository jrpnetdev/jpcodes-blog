**Bulletproof React** is an open-source project and architecture guide for building **scalable, maintainable, and production-ready React applications**. It isn’t a framework or library, but rather a **set of best practices**, folder structures, patterns, and conventions you can follow to avoid common pitfalls when apps grow large.

https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react

### 🔍 What Bulletproof React Provides

- **Recommended project structure**
  A clear, opinionated folder organization to keep code modular and maintainable.
- **Best practices for React + TypeScript**
  Guidance on typing, component patterns, hooks, and state management.
- **Architectural patterns**
  How to separate concerns (UI, business logic, data fetching).
- **Scalable abstractions**
  Feature-based and domain-driven approaches that grow with your project.
- **Examples of real-world patterns**
  Including caching, testing, environment handling, API layers, and more.

### 💡 Why It's Popular

Developers like Bulletproof React because it helps them:

- avoid “spaghetti” codebases as projects grow,
- onboard new team members more easily,
- maintain long-term consistency,
- integrate with modern tooling (Vite, React Query, Zustand/Recoil, etc.).

### 📌 Source

Bulletproof React is a GitHub project (by Alan A. / “alan2207”), often used as a reference for production-grade React project architecture.

# 1. **Bulletproof React Architecture — Full Summary**

Bulletproof React provides an **opinionated architecture** for building scalable React + TypeScript apps. Its goal is to help teams avoid the chaos that happens when a project grows without structure.

At a high level, it encourages:

### **✔ Feature-based organization**

Instead of organizing by technical type (`components/`, `hooks/`, etc.), you organize by domain or feature.
Each feature maintains its own UI components, hooks, tests, and types.

### **✔ Clear separation of concerns**

It divides app code into layers such as:

- **UI layer** – components, layouts, pages
- **Hooks layer** – view logic
- **Services layer** – API calls, caching, business logic
- **State layer** – React Query, Zustand, or other client state
- **Utils & shared modules**

This makes the dependencies flow in one direction: **feature → shared**, not the other way around.

### **✔ A consistent approach to:**

- API interaction (via dedicated service modules)
- Error handling
- Data fetching and caching (React Query recommended)
- Environment variables
- Testing (React Testing Library + Jest)
- Reusable components (co-located or in a shared library)
- Types & interfaces

It is less a rigid standard and more a **template for maintainable React codebases**.

# 2. **Recommended Folder Structure**

Here is the core structure used in Bulletproof React:

```
src/
 ├─ app/               # App-wide providers, routing, entry files
 ├─ assets/            # Static files (images, icons, fonts)
 ├─ components/        # Reusable UI components (shared)
 ├─ config/            # Global config (env vars, constants)
 ├─ features/          # Feature-based modules
 │   └─ auth/
 │        ├─ api/
 │        ├─ components/
 │        ├─ hooks/
 │        ├─ routes/
 │        ├─ types/
 │        └─ index.ts
 ├─ hooks/             # Global (shared) custom hooks
 ├─ lib/               # 3rd-party wrappers and utilities
 ├─ providers/         # App-level React providers
 ├─ routes/            # Route definitions & layout organization
 ├─ services/          # External API services (HTTP clients)
 ├─ stores/            # Global state (Zustand/Recoil/etc.)
 ├─ types/             # Global TypeScript definitions
 └─ utils/             # Pure utility functions
```

### Key ideas in the structure:

- Every **feature** is self-contained and can include:
  - UI components
  - state logic
  - API abstraction
  - types
  - tests
  - utilities

- The **shared** folders (`components/`, `utils/`, `types/`) hold code reused by multiple features.

- All external dependencies (e.g., Axios, Zod) get wrapped in `lib/` so the rest of the app doesn’t depend on library internals.

- The `app/` directory is the entry point for:
  - router
  - global providers
  - global styles
  - theme

This structure scales smoothly as you add more features.

# 3. **Philosophy & Key Principles**

### **1. Feature Isolation**

Keep features modular and self-contained.
This makes both scaling and refactoring easier.

### **2. Minimize global/shared code**

Global code increases coupling.
Only share code that truly needs to be reused across features.

### **3. Explicit boundaries**

Use:

- dedicated API modules,
- separate data-fetching logic,
- type-safe DTOs,
- clear public interfaces (`index.ts` entrypoints).

This helps enforce directionality and prevents spaghetti imports.

### **4. Predictability over cleverness**

The architecture favors:

- consistent patterns,
- readable abstractions,
- minimal “magic,”
- simple naming conventions.

Engineers should always know where a piece of logic belongs.

### **5. Composition over inheritance**

React apps grow better when small pieces are composed, not inherited or deeply nested.

### **6. Testability**

Keeping logic separated (UI vs. hooks vs. data) makes everything easier to test.

### **7. Scalability through boundaries**

By grouping code by business domain, not technical type, the project scales naturally with feature growth.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
src/
 ├─ app/               # App entry, router, global providers
 ├─ assets/            # Images, fonts, global styles

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 18**
- **TypeScript**
- **Vite** (recommended for use)
- **React Router**
- **React Query**
- **Axios**

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd bulletproof-react-starter
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧩 Example Feature Structure

Each feature is isolated and contains everything related to that domain:

```
features/example/
 ├─ api/
 ├─ components/
 ├─ hooks/
 ├─ types/
 └─ index.ts
```

Example uses React Query + Axios to fetch and cache data cleanly.

---

## 🌐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the root:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your.api
```

---

## 🧰 Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server
npm run build     # Production build
npm run preview   # Preview the build
```

---

## 🧪 Testing (Optional Recommendation)

This template is compatible with:

- **Vitest**
- **React Testing Library**
- **MSW** for API mocking

Testing is not included by default but can be added easily.

---

## 🏗️ Extending the Template

You can integrate:

- **shadcn/ui** (highly recommended)
- **Zustand or Jotai** for global state
- **Zod** for schema validation
- **TanStack Router** (alternative to React Router)
- **Feature-based design tokens**

If you'd like, I can generate an extended version with these tools.
